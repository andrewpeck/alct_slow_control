WARNING:NgdBuild:383 - A case sensitive search for the INST, PAD, or NET
   element refered to by a constraint entry in the UCF file that accompanies
   this design has failed, while a case insensitive search is in progress. The
   result of the case insenstive search will be used, but warnings will
   accompany each and every use of a case insensitive result. Constraints are
   case sensitive with respect to user-specified identifiers, which includes
   names of logic elements in a design. For the sake of compatibility with
   currently existing .xnf, .xtf, and .xff files, Software will allow a case
   insensitive search for INST, PAD, or NET elements referenced in a .ucf file.
WARNING:NgdBuild:385 - Found case insensitive match for NET name 'tck'. NET is
   'TCK'.

The design submitted for place and route did not meet the specified timing
requirements.  Please use the static timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing
Analyzer) to report which constraints were not met.  To obtain a better result,
you may try the following:
  * Use the Re-entrant routing feature to run more router iterations on the
design.
  * Check the timing constraints to make sure the design is not
over-constrained.
  * Specify a higher placer effort level, if possible.
  * Specify a higher router effort level.
  * Use the Multi-Pass PAR (MPPR) feature.  This generates multiple placement
trials from which the best (i.e., lowest design score) placement can be used
with re-entrant routing to obtain a better result.

Please consult the Development System Reference Guide for more detailed
information about the usage options pertaining to these features.
